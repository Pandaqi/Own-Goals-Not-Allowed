# Own Goals Not Allowed

The source code for my game [Own Goals Not Allowed](https://pandaqi.com/own-goals-not-allowed).

Just a simple "One Week Game" asking the question "what if you played soccer, local multiplayer, but on multiple fields at the same time?"

It was made in an early beta version of Godot 4.
